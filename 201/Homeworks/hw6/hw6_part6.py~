# Description: This program generates the levels of Pascal's triangle using 
# recursion.

# getValidInput() gets a valid integer based on the users ranges
# Input:          userNum; the integer being checked
#                 minimum; the minimum number that is allowed
# Output:         userInt; integer above the minimium

# pascal() uses recursion to create each level of Pascal's
# triangle, reaching the requested height
# Input: currLevel; an int, the current level being created
# levelsToMake; an int, the number of levels requested
# levelList; a 2D list of ints, containing the levels
# as they are created
# Output: None (levelList is changed in place, and the updated
# levelList will be the same in main() )
